About
-----
This How-To documents how to duplicate this website setup at both
GitLab and on the Stanford webserver.

Prerequisites Notes
-------------------

1.  It is assumed that you already have an account on GitLab and
    that you have already set up your GitLab credentials.  That
    process is not detailed here, but is well-documented at
    https://gitlab.com/.

2.  It is assumed that you already have a group directory on the
    Stanford webserver, and are authorized to log into it.  The
    process for setting up that directory (as of November 2019)
    is detailed here:

         Browser -> https://uit.stanford.edu/service/web/centralhosting/howto_group

    Note:  this only provides you the long and unwieldly URL,
    https://web.stanford.edu/group/<group>.  Once you have been
    granted this, you can then obtain the more compact ("vanity"
    or "reserved") URL, https://<group>.stanford.edu/, by filing
    a "proxy" request.  The process for obtaining that is
    detailed (as of November 2019) here:

         Browser -> https://uit.stanford.edu/service/vhost

Setting up the Website
----------------------
A.  GitLab setup (as of November 2019).

    1.  Go to https://gitlab.com/ and sign in.

    2.  Create a new group, with a unique name (for example,
        "stanford-dancebreak").  You'll probably want to make the
        group "Private" (so that projects can only be viewed by
        group members, and cannot be publicly searched for).

    3.  Create a new project under the new group (for example,
        "website").  Use the "Blank project" tab.  (Note:  by
        default, the new project will be "Private" if the group
        was set to "Private," above.)

    4.  GitLab provides instructions for populating the new
        (empty) repository.  Follow the set that matches your
        situation.  (Most likely, you have a directory of files
        not already controlled by git, so use the "Existing
        folder" instructions.)

B.  Stanford webserver setup (as of November 2019).

    1.  SSH onto rice.

        > ssh [your-sunet-id]@rice.stanford.edu

    2.  Create the website directory (if necessary) and go to it.

        > mkdir -m 0755 /afs/ir.stanford.edu/group/dancebreak/WWW
        > cd /afs/ir.stanford.edu/group/dancebreak/WWW

    3.  Clone the latest version into the website directory
        (you'll need your GitLab credentials).

        > git clone https://gitlab.com/stanford-dancebreak/website local

        NOTE (GitLab credentials):  you only need your GitLab
        username and password here; you will not need any SSH
        keys.  In fact, you will be prompted for them -- e.g. you
        should see

            > git clone https://gitlab.com/stanford-dancebreak/website local
            Username for 'https://gitlab.com': Tatiana
            Password for 'https://Tatiana@gitlab.com':

        NEVER UPLOAD YOUR SSH KEYS TO rice FOR THIS PURPOSE!

    4.  Move the website contents into the main area.  WARNING:
        pay close attention to spaces and punctuation marks in
        the command -- they are all required!

        > mv local/.* local/* .

        NOTE (warning messages):  you will see warning messages,
        which you can ignore -- e.g. you should see

            > mv local/.* local/* .
            mv: cannot move 'local/.' to './.': Device or resource busy
            mv: cannot move 'local/..' to './..': Device or resource busy

    5.  Remove git metadata to prevent leakage of private data,
        such as email addresses of maintainers.  (Although the
        .htaccess file is set up to prevent access via the web,
        this ensures that there is no data to leak.)

        > rm -fr ./.git*

    6.  Clean up.

        > rmdir local

    7.  Done!
