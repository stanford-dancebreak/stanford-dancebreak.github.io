          <p><strong>History</strong></p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Dancebreak began in Fall 2005, as &quot;Faster
          Polka&quot; because we loved faster-tempo music than
          was normally played at Jammix and Friday Night Waltz,
          especially polkas.  (Also, we assumed it would force us
          to come up with a better name.)  In those days, each
          quarter Richard Powers taught non-Stanford social dance
          series courses that were open to both students and the
          outside community on Thursday nights, 7-10pm.  In
          addition, Roble Gym closed at 10:50pm.  This left the
          big studio unused for the final 50 minutes (since no
          group wanted the space at that late hour for such short
          a block of time).  When we realized that, we asked for
          (and received) permission from Richard to stay after
          his class and use the big studio.  This provided us a
          nice, if short, weekly dance where we decided what
          music to play and dances to dance.  5 weeks into the
          quarter, Richard's courses would conclude, and because
          no other group was already reserving the big studio for
          Thursday nights, we could make our start time earlier,
          thus enjoying an even-longer weekly dance of our
          own!</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>In Spring 2009, concerned we were giving people the
          wrong impression about our focus (and possibly
          unintentionally intimidating them), we finally renamed
          ourselves &mdash; to &quot;Dancebreak.&quot;</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Richard's non-Stanford classes moved off-campus in
          Winter 2010, and other groups wanted Thursday nights
          too, so we chose to try different nights.  We have
          mostly alternated between Monday and Wednesday nights,
          with Mondays being preferred due to potential conflict
          with other dance events on other weeknights.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>We became an official Voluntary Student Organization
          in Fall 2013, thanks to the efforts of Tatiana
          Kuzovleva (BS 2015), who became our first president.
          Roble Gym was scheduled to be closed for a long-overdue
          renovation starting Summer 2013 (the renovation
          actually began 1 year late).  Although this didn't
          immediately affect us (Dancebreak holds regular
          sessions only during the academic year), it forced us
          to look for alternative space on campus, many of which
          were unavailable except to student groups (or charged
          fees).  That motivated us to become an actual student
          group.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>In the final weeks of Winter 2020, we went on
          indefinite hiatus due to the
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic"
             target=_blank">ongoing COVID-19 pandemic</a>.  After
          Santa Clara County (which includes Stanford) issued its
          <a href="https://www.sccgov.org/sites/phd/DiseaseInformation/novel-coronavirus/Pages/order-health-officer-031620.aspx"
             target=_blank">&quot;shelter in place&quot; orders</a>,
          the University immediate decided to
          <a href="https://healthalerts.stanford.edu/2020/03/16/stanford-update-for-monday-evening-march-16/"
             target=_blank">follow them</a>, effectively emptying
          the campus (all undergraduate students were required to
          leave campus housing).</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Dancebreak's focus has changed over the years.
          Originally, most attendees were dancers in Richard's
          9pm class, which was usually intermediate-level.  Thus
          we tended to play music for intermediate level dancing
          (such as faster polkas, a particular favorite of the
          early crowd).  After Richard started holding his
          non-Stanford classes off-campus, and especially after
          the early attendees graduated, we shifted our focus to
          being a practica for Richard's Stanford dance classes,
          in order to help and encourage new dancers to discover
          a love and passion for social dancing like the original
          dancers had.</p>
