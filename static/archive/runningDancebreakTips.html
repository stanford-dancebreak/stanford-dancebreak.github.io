          <p><strong>Tips For Running Dancebreak</strong></p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>These tips for running Dancebreak sessions are
          focused on helping us survive and thrive in the
          long-term.  To that end, here are the 3 main priorities
          to keep in mind, starting with the highest:</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <div id="noParaIndent">
            <em><ol type="12345">
              <li><p><a href="runningDancebreakTips.html#priority-1-keep-in-big-studio">Keep
                Dancebreak in Roble Gym's big
                studio.</a></p></li>
              <li><p><a href="runningDancebreakTips.html#priority-2-make-new-return">Make
                new attendees want to come back.</a></p></li>
              <li><p><a href="runningDancebreakTips.html#priority-3-play-great">Play great
                dance music.</a></p></li>
            </ol></em>
          </div>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Most DJs are probably expecting just &num;3, but
          that is, in fact, the lowest priority one!</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <ul class="tips"><li><em>Ask for help!</em>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>It's okay to have help, especially from other
            Dancebreak officers and regulars.  But remember that
            <strong><em>you</em></strong> are ultimately in
            charge of (and responsible for) all the
            following.</p>
          </li></ul>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <!-- ======================= -->
          <!-- Priority 1 starts here. -->
          <!-- ======================= -->
          <a id="priority-1-keep-in-big-studio"><div
          class="horizontalLine" style="float:left"></div></a>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p><strong>Priority 1:  Keep Dancebreak in Roble Gym's
          big studio</strong></p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>The best location for Dancebreak is <a
          href="http://maps.stanford.edu/ada/building-ada.cfm?FACIL_ID=04-650"
          target="_blank">Roble Gym</a>'s big studio.  It is by
          far the best (biggest) dance studio, with the best
          availability, in a great location, with excellent
          amenities.  Dancing anywhere else will result in far
          fewer attendees, especially new dancers, and thus
          Dancebreak's slow death.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p><em>But,</em> Dancebreak can use it only because the
          <a href="https://taps.stanford.edu/"
          target="_blank">TAPS Department</a> lets us, and
          they'll ban our usage if we're bad studio users.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <ul class="tips"><li><em>Make sure everyone knows the
            important studio-use rules.</em>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Keep the studio clean:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>No food.</li>
              <li>No drinks (except water in a resealable
                container).</li>
              <li>No glass.</li>
              <li>No street shoes.</li>
              <li>Don't let anyone in through the
                building-exterior doors.  (Keep them closed at
                all times.)</li>
            </ul>
          </li></ul>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <ul class="tips"><li><em>Stop all music
            10 minutes before closing, then make everyone leave
            promptly.</em>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Give everyone, including yourself, plenty of time
              to pick up and leave Roble Gym.  Building managers
              require everyone to exit the building before
              closing.  Otherwise, they report violators to the
              TAPS Department.</p>
          </li></ul>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <ul class="tips"><li><em>Be polite, but firm and prompt
            in fixing violations.</em>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>If you are busy correcting violations, then you
              are wasting your and the dancers' valuable studio
              time.  If you have a &quot;zero-tolerance&quot;
              policy, then people are less likely to try breaking
              rules.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Don't negotiate (&quot;in a minute,&quot;
              &quot;after this dance,&quot; &quot;it's okay this
              one time,&quot; &quot;it's my friend&quot;).  It
              wastes valuable time.  It also implies that you
              might allow violations.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Correct violations immediately:  visible,
              uncorrected violations convey the message that
              they're permitted.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Always be polite, but firm.</p>
          </li></ul>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <!-- ======================= -->
          <!-- Priority 2 starts here. -->
          <!-- ======================= -->
          <a id="priority-2-make-new-return"><div
          class="horizontalLine" style="float:left"></div></a>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p><strong>Priority 2:  Make new attendees want to come
          back</strong></p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>New Dancebreak attendees will want to return if they
          had fun and felt welcomed into our community.  Dancing
          is already intimidating, especially for those who don't
          know how to dance.  It's even moreso if they don't know
          anyone.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <ul class="tips"><li><em>Proactively engage with new
            folks.</em>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Talk to new people (more than just a
                &quot;Hello&quot;).  Dance with each one.</li>
              <li>If a lot of new people come, take a few minutes
                to have the whole group welcome them.</li>
              <li>Explain to them how Dancebreak works.</li>
              <li>Ask them to sign up for our mailing list.</li>
            </ul>
          </li></ul>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <ul class="tips"><li><em>Help new dancers enjoy
            themselves.</em>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Do a &quot;dance with strangers.&quot;</li>
              <li>Play more (and slower-tempo) music that allows
                them to do the dances they know.</li>
              <li>Help them with their dancing.  Be great leads
                or follows.  Gently ask them if they would like
                tips.</li>
              <li>Encourage them to dance, especially if they say
                they can't.  (&quot;I don't know how to
                dance.&quot; &quot;No problem, I'd love to help
                you learn/practice!&quot;)</li>
              <li>Learn what Richard taught the previous week in
                <a href="https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?q=%22powers%2C+r.%22"
                target="_blank">his classes</a>, especially
                <a href="https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?q=%22social+dance+I%22"
                target="_blank">Social Dance I</a>, and play
                plenty of songs for them to practice with.</li>
              <li>Teach them an easy, useful dance choreography,
                like
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_S9fb02Vi-c"
                target="_blank"><em>Bus Stop</em></a> (or
                <em>Night Fever</em>, Dancebreak's unofficial
                official line dance).  Then have everyone dance
                it to music.</li>
            </ul>
          </li></ul>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <ul class="tips"><li><em>Create 2 song playlists.</em>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>If you don't feel comfortable selecting songs
              on-the-fly, then create 2 playlists beforehand:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Find out what your regulars like, and build one
                90-minute playlist based on that.
              <li>Build a second 90-minute playlist focused on
                music for Richard's classes' topics, particularly
                Social Dance I (see previous TIP).
              <li>Select songs based on the dancers present in
                the big studio, with more emphasis on the needs
                of new dancers.
            </ul>
          </li></ul>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <ul class="tips"><li><em>Read
            <a href="http://socialdance.stanford.edu/syllabi/DJtips.htm"

            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Really take to heart the main, enumerated points
              at the top!</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <ul class="tips"><li><em>Double-check with experienced
            DJs.</em>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>If this is the first time you're DJing, re-read
              the previous TIP (i.e. re-read Richard's &quot;DJ
              Tips&quot; page)!</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Then ask other Dancebreak DJs for suggestions and
              tips.</p>
          </li></ul>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <ul class="tips"><li><em>Listen to your music through
            the device's speakers; never headphones.</em>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Or, if possible, find a moment when the big studio
              is empty and listen through those speakers.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Do <em>not</em> listen with your headphones.  What
              you hear will be far clearer than what dancers can
              through the big studio's speakers and acoustics and
              fellow dancers' bodies.  In the big studio, beats
              may be less clear, and music may be less crisp.  If
              you can hear the important song components through
              your phone's or laptop's speakers, then there's a
              good chance that they'll be clear enough in the big
              studio.</p>
            <p>Then ask other Dancebreak DJs for suggestions and
              tips.</p>
          </li></ul>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <ul class="tips"><li><em>Play slower music than might
            be good for yourself.</em>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>For new dancers, with less experience than you (or
              none), tempos that are comfortable for you are
              probably too fast for them.  Use 5-10% slower tempo
              music, or the lower end of the &quot;acceptable
              range&quot; tempos on Richard's &quot;DJ Tips&quot;
              page.  Make them feel like they <em>can</em> dance,
              rather than <em>cannot</em>.</p>
          </li></ul>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <ul class="tips"><li><em>Be wary of streaming services,
            like Spotify.</em>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Prefer to use song files stored on your own
              device.<p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Many songs used in the social dance community are
              edited versions, while streaming services only
              provide the originals, which can be harder to dance
              to (or undanceable).  Also, some services, like
              Spotify, are known to <em>replace</em> uploaded
              edited versions with the original
              (&quot;correct&quot;) versions!<p>
          </li></ul>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <ul class="tips"><li><em>Avoid songs with fun lyrics
            and dull melodies.</em>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>As Richard notes on his &quot;DJ Tips&quot; page,
              &quot;dancers are too occupied with dancing to be
              listening to the lyrics.&quot; This is especially
              true for new dancers.  If the music is boring, it
              won't matter how interesting the lyrics are.</p>
          </li></ul>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <ul class="tips"><li><em>Don't play your
            &quot;favorite&quot; songs that aren't
            danceable.</em>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>No matter how long you've been dying to dance to
              them in the big studio, if they're not objectively
              danceable then you're wasting the dancers' valuable
              time and interest.</p>
          </li></ul>
