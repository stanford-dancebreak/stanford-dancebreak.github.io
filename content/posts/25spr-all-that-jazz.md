**This Saturday April 19th, Stanford Swing Dancers and Dancebreak Present: All That Jazz!**

Join us for a Lindy Hop and waltz crossover event with workshops and social
dancing! Bring your friends, lovers, loose acquaintances, and enemies to a
fantastic night — flier below!

**5-7 pm in [RAG 116][roble]: Beginner crossover Lindy hop and waltz workshop!** If you
have danced neither dance before or know only a little bit of one or the other
(e.g. not meeting intermediate qualifications for one of the two styles), this
is for you — we’ll give you a crash course in Lindy hop and in the social
waltzes done here at Stanford!

**5-7pm in [Roble 114][roble]: Intermediate crossover Lindy hop and waltz workshop!** If
you are meeting the criteria below for _at least one of the two_ dance styles,
join us for an intermediate crossover workshop focused on using what you
already know in one style to get a jumpstart in the other style, and to make
each style feel more comfortable!

_Lindy hop prerequisites:_ comfortable with 6 and 8 count footwork, tuck turns, swingouts and Lindy circles, groove walks/lollies

_Waltz prerequisites:_ rotary and/or cross step waltz basic steps, polka basic steps, turns, waltz walks, pancakes

**7-10pm in [Roble 113][roble]: Social dancing!**

Three spectacular hour-long sets:
1. All That Jazz (Lindy Hop to classic Lindy music + jazz waltzes),
2. None Of That Jazz (Lindy to ostensibly-Lindy-able music that’s not necessarily your typical SSD fare + fave waltzes from Dancebreak), and the
3. Last Set (to be determined based on which group is better represented, with more Lindy if there are more Lindy folks and more waltz if there are more waltz folks)
