## Viennese Ball

The biggest Stanford ball of the year is the [Stanford Viennese Ball][vball].
This year, Dancebreak is providing a limited number of financial aid tickets
for members who would otherwise be unable to attend the Viennese Ball for
financial reasons; [fill out this form to be considered for financial aid
tickets](https://forms.gle/sXoPFgwbQHuBCNew6).  Priority will go to applicants
with financial need and Dancebreak regulars.

## Other Socials

These events aren't run by Dancebreak, but may be of interest.  If you have
