Information in italics is still tentative.

If you're looking for even more, our friends at [Stanford Swing Dancers][ssd]
and [Cardinal West Coast Swing][wcs] teach workshops in Lindy Hop and West
Coast Swing almost every week on campus. [Friday Night Waltz][fnw] also runs
weekly lessons on various kinds of dance just off-campus.

## Descriptions

### Viennese Ball Audition Workshops (Week 1)

We partner with the [Viennese Ball Opening
Committee](https://vienneseball.stanford.edu) to run workshops before their
auditions.

Auditions are 9/28 at 10:00 AM in [Roble 113][roble].

### Beginner Waltz Sequence (Weeks 3-8)

Come learn to Waltz with us!
* Rotary Waltz is the traditional style of waltz, done since the late 18th
century.  We do it to [a wide range of pop songs][lod-rotary].
* [Cross-Step Waltz][xstep] is a more modern form of waltz which is really
popular at Stanford (and invented here in the 90s, at least in part).

Our beginner workshops assume no dance experience of any sort (although
experienced dancers are welcome as well, of course).  Our "office hours" are an
informal way to learn to dance, to practice/get feedback, or to hone a
particular skill.
