We have several workshops planned this quarter, for beginners and experienced
dancers alike!

## Beginner Waltz Sequence

Come learn to Waltz with us!
* Rotary Waltz is the traditional style of waltz, done since the late 18th
century.  We do it to [a wide range of pop songs][lod-rotary].
* [Cross-Step Waltz][xstep] is a more modern form of waltz which is really
popular at Stanford (and invented here in the 90s, at least in part).

Our beginner workshops assume no dance experience of any sort (although
experienced dancers are welcome as well, of course).
