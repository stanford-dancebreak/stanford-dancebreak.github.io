## What is Dancebreak?

Dancebreak is a weekly, free, DJed casual social dancing event for the Stanford
community, featuring a variety of dance styles with a focus on waltz and swing!
Come hang out with our campus's largest social dancing crew, practice styles
taught in Richard Powers's Social Dance class series, learn new moves, and have
fun with us.  **No dance experience or partner needed.**

We dance every Monday night, usually in Roble 113 7-9pm (but this is
**extremely** subject to change---the best way to keep up is through [our
mailing list][mail]).  Join us for social dancing, classes, snacks, and
community!

If you don't know how to social dance, we have lessons (almost) every week! See
the [list of workshops](/workshops) for details, or check out the schedule for
the next few weeks below.  We also teach (with a bunch of other clubs) classes
every day during [Austria Fortnight](/fortnight), the two weeks leading up to
the [Stanford Viennese Ball][vball].
