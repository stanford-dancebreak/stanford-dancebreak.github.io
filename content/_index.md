## Do I need to know how to dance?

No!  Beginners are always welcome, we love teaching people how to dance.  We
also have scheduled lessons/workshops for people looking for a bit more
structure.

## When/Where?

**When:**   Usually 7-9PM on Mondays

**Where:**  In theory Roble Gym, Studio 113... but due to scheduling
constraints we sometimes meet in other places.  Join our mailing list or follow
us on Instagram for up-to-date info!
