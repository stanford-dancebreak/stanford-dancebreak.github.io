## What is Dancebreak?

Dancebreak is a social dancing club for the Stanford community, featuring a
variety of dance styles with a focus on waltz and swing! Come learn how to
dance, hang out with our campus's largest social dancing crew, practice styles
taught in Richard Powers's Social Dance class series, learn new moves, and have
fun with us. **No dance experience or partner needed.**

We dance every Monday night, but the location and time are subject to
change---the best way to keep up is through [our mailing list][mail].  Join us
for social dancing, classes, snacks, and community!

If you don't know how to dance, we teach lessons every week! See the [list of
workshops](/workshops) for details, or take a peek at the schedule for the next
few weeks below.  [Check out our FAQ if you have more questions!](/info/faq)

## Upcoming Lessons and Dances

No need to come with a partner---we rotate partners often in class! Each lesson
is followed by a two-hour DJed dance social, either in the same location or
nearby.
