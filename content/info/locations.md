Dancebreak happens in a few different locations around campus, depending on
when/where we can get room bookings.

## Roble Gym

Address: [375 Santa Teresa St.](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZBMV5zSnVvFHrEfA6)

Gendered bathrooms are located along the wall of the courtyard opposite the
lobby; an accessible all-gender bathroom is located in the hallway next to
Roble 113 on the side closest to the lobby.

Drinking fountains are present in the hallway next to Roble 113 (towards the
building entrance), and a bottle refilling station is present in the hallway
towards Roble 115 (away from the building entrance).

### Studio 113

1. Enter Roble Gym via the main entrance.
2. Walk through the lobby to the center courtyard.
3. Turn left and walk into the big dance studio.

This studio has a sprung wood floor.  Per building policy, no street shoes are
allowed in the studio; clean dance shoes, socks, or bare feet are acceptable.

This room has an excellent sound system.  It also has a TV; however, the TV can
be finicky to get working.  Note that the audio cable in the room is often only
partially functional (e.g., only one of the two audio channels works); using
one of the Dancebreak audio cables is the better option.  Instructors in this
room need microphones to be audible.

This is the largest (and best) dance studio on campus, but also the most
in-demand.

### Studio 114

1. Enter Roble Gym via the main entrance.
2. Walk through the lobby to the center courtyard.
3. Cross the courtyard to the far left corner.
4. Walk through the door that leads towards the _side_ of the building (into a
   stairwell).
5. The door to Roble 114 is directly ahead, past the stairs (the stairs lead to
   Roble 113).

This studio has a sprung wood floor.  Per building policy, no street shoes are
allowed in the studio; clean dance shoes, socks, or bare feet are acceptable.

This room has a good sound system, but no TV.  It is suitable for stationary
and slotted dances, but it's too small for traveling ones (although it will
suffice for waltz lessons if nothing better is available).

### Studio 115

1. Enter Roble Gym via the main entrance.
2. Walk through the lobby to the center courtyard.
3. Cross the courtyard to the far left corner.
4. Walk into the hallway that leads towards the back of the building; Studio
   115 is on the left.

This studio has a clean cushioned marley floor.  Per building policy, no street
shoes are allowed in the studio; clean dance shoes, socks, or bare feet are
acceptable.

This room has a good sound system, but no TV.

### Room 116

This room is part of [Roble Arts Gym](https://arts.stanford.edu/office-of-the-vice-president-for-the-arts/roble-arts-gym/roble-arts-gym-reservable-spaces/).

1. Enter Roble Gym via the main entrance.
2. Walk through the lobby to the center courtyard.
3. Cross straight through the courtyard to the far side.
4. Room 116 functions as a space for many kinds of art; the dance floor is
   located at the back of the space.

This room has no integrated sound system; we use the Dancebreak speaker
instead.

## Graduate Community Center

Address: [750 Escondido Rd.](https://maps.app.goo.gl/nyGgDy75Ww5Njmt49)

Gendered bathrooms are located within Ray's Grill.  Water may be available from
Ray's Grill.

### Havana Room

From outside:

1. Face the building from the street.
2. Go around the right side of the building.
3. Enter through the doors on the side.

From inside:

1. Face the building from the street.
2. Enter Ray's Grill.
3. Walk into the building and turn right.
4. Enter through the double doors.

While this venue has an in-room sound system (which requires an AUX cable), it
is unreliable and should be avoided.  We use the Dancebreak speaker in this
venue instead.  This room has a projector which is usable, although not very
bright. Instructors in this venue need microphones if there are more than about
40 attendees.

## Elliott Program Center

Address: [589 Governor's Ave.](https://maps.app.goo.gl/CaveBzf8iHpvb1Dd9)

Gendered and all-gender bathrooms are located in the hallway within the
building.  Drinking fountains are available in the same hallway.

### Common Room

1. Walk around the building to the side closest to Lake Lag.
2. Ascend the stairs onto the patio.
3. Enter through through the doors facing the patio, on the wall parallel to
   the lake.

This room's A/V system is not generally usable; we use the Dancebreak speaker
instead.  Instructors in this venue need microphones if there are more than
about 40 attendees.

## Escondido Village Graduate Residences

An all-gender bathroom and a bottle filling station are located in a passageway
in EVGR-B, between the central wing and the wing closest to Campus Drive.

### EVGR B140 (Yoga Studio)

1. Stand directly between the entrances to EVGR-B and EVGR-C.
2. Walk towards (but do not enter) EVGR-B.
3. Turn right and walk along the side of the building until you reach Studio 140.

This room has a TV with mediocre sound quality (but which has bluetooth), and
an in-room sound system with relatively good sound quality (which requires an
AUX cable).  We often use the Dancebreak speaker instead, but it is not strictly needed.

strictly needed.

## Rains Houses

### Hacienda Commons

Address: [796 Escondido Rd.](https://maps.app.goo.gl/R5nvePgB2JsrQTzM8)

The main entrances to this room are from the courtyard.

This room has a screen made up of nine TVs; often only seven or eight will turn
on.  There is a sound system but it's unclear how to connect to it; we use the
Dancebreak speaker instead.  Instructors here need microphones if there are
more than about 40 attendees.  This room is, as of February 2025,
capacity-limited to 40 people due to nearby construction.
