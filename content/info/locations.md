Dancebreak happens in a few different locations around campus, depending on
when/where we can get room bookings.

## Roble Gym

Address: [375 Santa Teresa St.](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZBMV5zSnVvFHrEfA6)

Gendered bathrooms are located along the wall of the courtyard opposite the
lobby; an accessible all-gender bathroom is located in the hallway next to
Roble 113 on the side closest to the lobby.

Drinking fountains are present in the hallway next to Roble 113 (towards the
building entrance), and a bottle refilling station is present in the hallway
towards Roble 115 (away from the building entrance).

### Studio 113

1. Enter Roble Gym via the main entrance.
2. Walk through the lobby to the center courtyard.
3. Turn left and walk into the big dance studio.

This studio has a clean sprung wood floor.  Per building policy, no street
shoes are allowed in the studio; clean dance shoes, socks, or bare feet are
acceptable.

This room has an excellent sound system.  It also has a TV.

This is the largest (and best) dance studio on campus, but also the most
in-demand.

### Studio 115

1. Enter Roble Gym via the main entrance.
2. Walk through the lobby to the center courtyard.
3. Cross the courtyard to the far left corner.
4. Walk into the hallway that leads towards the back of the building; Studio
   115 is on the left.

This studio has a clean cushioned wood floor.  Per building policy, no street
shoes are allowed in the studio; clean dance shoes, socks, or bare feet are
acceptable.

### Studio 114

1. Enter Roble Gym via the main entrance.
2. Walk through the lobby to the center courtyard.
3. Cross the courtyard to the far left corner.
4. Walk through the door that leads towards the _side_ of the building (into a
   stairwell).
5. The door to Roble 114 is directly ahead, past the stairs (the stairs lead to
   Roble 113).

This studio has a sprung wood floor.  Per building policy, no street shoes are
allowed in the studio; clean dance shoes, socks, or bare feet are acceptable.

This room has a good sound system, but no TV.  It is suitable for stationary
and slotted dances, but it's too small for traveling ones.

The main entrances to this room are from the courtyard.

mid-2024 in a way that makes it suboptimal for dance, but it is usable if
necessary.
