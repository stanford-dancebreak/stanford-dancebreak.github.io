title: Frequently Asked Questions
---
## Do I need a partner?

* No, you can absolutely come alone---in fact, that‚Äôs what most people do!
  Everyone at Dancebreak dances with everyone else (that includes you!). The
  "social" in "social dancing" is taken very seriously!  

* General social dance etiquette calls that you usually switch partners
  entirely for each song- and there are a lot of songs in a two/three hour
  period! As a result, people tend to dance with new folk a lot! That‚Äôs why
  social dancing is actually one of the best activities to go alone to---people
  are usually dancing with people they just met.

## How am I going to dance if I don't know anyone there?
* Anyone can ask anyone else to dance---people often ask people they do not
  know to dance as well! Simply ask someone standing around the dance floor-
  ‚ÄúWould you like to dance?‚Äù. If they say yes, ask ‚ÄúWould you like to lead or
  follow?‚Äù And then you‚Äôll be off!  

* If you‚Äôre not sure how to approach the crowd- come ask for a Dancebreak
  officer---we‚Äôd be happy to dance with you and find you some other folk to
  dance with!  

## I'm a beginner!
* We all remember what it was like to dance as a beginner- so come practice
  with us! There will always be someone down to show you some cool new moves,
  or help you with the ones you know!  

## I don't know all the dances!
* Neither do most other folks at Dancebreak! Most people only really dance a
  couple styles and fake their way through the rest of them. In the end, we‚Äôre
  just being silly and having fun.   

## I know like, a move and a half.
* Social dancing is about **having fun**---not knowing every cool move or
  getting all your moves right or trying to impress your partner. You can do a
  basic step for an entire dance and have fun---all you need is enthusiasm and
  a willingness to groove.   

## What do I wear?
* **Shoes:** All you need to know is that street shoes are not allowed on most
  dance floors as they muck up the floor---bring your socks, ballet flats, or
  just your bare feet.   
* **Dress Code:** We‚Äôre all about casual dancing---so feel free to come with
  just a t-shirt. But do take in mind that you *will* get hot and you *will*
  get sweaty---so bring an extra shirt to change into, and something cool to
  dance in.   
    * But feel free to also dress up! Lots of people see Dancebreak as a space
      where they can debut a new flowy dress or a new fit, since most people
      change into lighter clothing to dance in anyways. There really are no
      rules here.   

## Isn‚Äôt social dance gendered/not very queer-friendly?
* Social dance roles are composed of a lead and a follow, which while are
  historically gendered, are roles we are actively attempting to degender. You
  are welcome to learn how to dance and dance with **anyone you wish, in any
  role.**   
* While it is definitely easier to learn how to dance one role at a time,
  you‚Äôll notice that most dancers end up learning how to both lead and follow
  (which can lead to a lot of fun in-dance role switching!)  

## I have so much work to do though üò¢
* In five years are you going to remember dancing through the night like you‚Äôre
  in a fairytale or that paper you have to write? Yeah yeah, we both know the
  answer to that.   

## I have too many opps at Dancebreak üò†
* You ever see one of those playlists on youtube about [waltzing with your
  enemy](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=waltzing+with+your+enemy)?
  Yeah. That could be you! The enemies to lovers trope has [*never* been more
  popular](https://www.google.com/search?q=enemies+to+lovers&oq=enemies+to+lovers&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIGCAEQRRg8MgYIAhBFGDwyBggDEEUYPDIGCAQQLhhA0gEIMjU0MWowajSoAgCwAgE&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8).  
  * In seriousness- you don‚Äôt have to accept every invitation to dance. "No" is
    a complete answer.

## I‚Äôm someone that really needs to know the exact etiquette of a place before I go out dancing.
* and you‚Äôre so real for that! You‚Äôre always welcome to reach out with any
  additional questions about Dancebreak if anything pops up. Richard Powers
  also has some write-ups on social dance etiquette---feel free to give them a
  read as well!
