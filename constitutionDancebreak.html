          <p>Dancebreak</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p><strong>Article 2:  Purpose</strong></p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>The goal of Dancebreak is to make social dance more
          accessible to Stanford University students.  We seek to
          provide an opportunity for fun, high-level social
          dancing which requires little to no previous experience
          of any dance form and welcome beginners.  We hold
          weekly practices and encourage experimentation in
          creating new Stanford-based dances as well.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>The purpose of Dancebreak is to build a community of
          social dance enthusiasts and share opportunities to
          learn, practice, perform, and enjoy social dance.  We
          encourage dancers of all levels to interact and teach
          each other, and we provide opportunities for people to
          expand their dance repertoire beyond the classroom.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p><strong>Article 3: Activities and scope</strong></p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>The primary activity of our group is a weekly dance
          event during which we create a friendly atmosphere for
          people of all levels to enjoy social dance.  These
          events are open to all Stanford students, and we
          welcome newcomers throughout any time of the year.  We
          are a mixture of undergraduate and graduate students.
          We particularly encourage participation by students
          enrolled in the social dance classes taught at
          Stanford, by announcing Dancebreak in those classes and
          focusing sessions on what was taught in those classes
          the week prior.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>We also encourage members to arrange and attend
          other related events to help build the community feel
          within the group, such as DJing their own social dance
          events, and teaching social dance to members of the
          greater Stanford community.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <!-- ============================================= -->
          <div class="horizontalLine" style="float:left"></div>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p><strong>Article 4:  Membership</strong></p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>We are proud to welcome any Stanford student with an
          interest in social dance to our group and do not
          require any background experience in ballroom dancing
          or any dance form.  Our group is a mix of undergraduate
          and graduate students.  We are also a mix of students
          who have either taken or are currently taking social
          dance classes at Stanford, as well as other students
          with interest in social dance.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>To keep track of members we use CardinalSync (the
          current OSE group management website) and our mailing
          list.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Only currently registered Stanford students are
          eligible to become voting members, and must be
          registered on CardinalSync.  We have no dues,
          auditions, or attendance requirements, although
          attendance will be considered for officer elections.
          Only officers have work responsibilities at events,
          although volunteers are always appreciated.  Officers
          for the following year will be elected in late Spring
          and must be registered as a student for the following
          academic year.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>We expect that removal of a member will be a very
          rare incident, although should this come up we have the
          following process:  if a member feels uncomfortable
          about the presence of another member at a weekly dance
          event or other campus-based activity, they should bring
          this to the attention of one of the officers.  The
          officers will discuss and if seen fit will give the
          offending member a warning.  If the offending member
          does not improve their behavior by the next event, they
          will be asked to leave, and will be removed from the
          mailing list and CardinalSync, if applicable.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p><strong>Article 5: Leadership/Officers</strong></p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Our group has three official officer positions:
          President, Vice President, and Financial Officer.  To
          be eligible, officer candidates must be a registered
          student during the year in which they serve, be
          registered on CardinalSync, and have a strong
          attendance at weekly practices.  Officer election for
          the following year will occur in late spring, and will
          serve starting after the current academic year has
          ended (beginning of summer) until the following
          academic year ends.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>The positions and responsibilities are explained as
          follows:</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p><strong>President:</strong> handles organizational
          and logistical issues by registering and staying in the
          loop with OSE (the student group leadership, currently
          using CardinalSync as their web interface), booking the
          room for every dance event, and keeping documents
          updated.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p><strong>Vice President:</strong> in charge of
          getting information about our events to the public and
          general assistance to the president.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p><strong>Financial Officer:</strong> works on getting
          money from ASSU and GSC to support mostly room fees and
          any other costs for events.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>For elections, the group will be notified of an
          upcoming election and call for interested members.  Any
          eligible interested member should inform the current
          officers and will be considered for a position.  If
          considered qualified, they will become a candidate for
          that position.  If there are no other candidates for a
          position, then that individual will be selected.  If
          there are multiple candidates for a position, an
          anonymous voting system will be arranged either online
          or in-person, and only Stanford students will be
          eligible to vote.  Once selected, the current president
          will be responsible for re-registering the new officers
          on CardinalSync.  In addition, the upcoming Financial
          Officer will be required to attend the mandatory OSE
          financial orientation meetings.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Should a current officer be considered by another
          officer or group member to be inadequately carrying out
          the specified responsibilities for the position, an
          officer (or second officer) should be contacted.  All
          officers should meet to discuss the responsibilities of
          the position and involvement of the current officer.
          If after a period of two weeks the complaints about
          responsibilities remain, the officers will meet again
          to discuss and ask the officer to step down.  The
          remaining officers may shuffle positions if desired
          (although additional training may be required for the
          Financial Officer position), and then an email will be
          sent to the entire group explaining that the officer
          has chosen to step down due to exterior conflicts and
          the same officer election process as before will be
          used to select a candidate for the single position.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p><strong>Article 6: Decision making</strong></p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Any decision affecting the entire group will be put
          up to vote for all eligible voting members.  Advance
          notice will be given, then voting will be conducted and
          a simple majority will be required to pass.  Decisions
          should adhere to the purpose and disposition of the
          group.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p><strong>Article 7: Dissolution</strong></p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Dissolution must be voted on by 70% of all members
          in order to pass.  In the event that the group becomes
          dissolved, all funds will pass back to the ASSU or GSC,
          depending on source.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p><strong>Article 8: Amendment of constitution</strong></p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Any amendments made to the constitution must be
          agreed upon by all current officers as well as a simple
          majority of voting-eligible group members.  The
          president will be responsible for updating the
          constitution on CardinalSync after obtaining approval
          from OSE.</p>
