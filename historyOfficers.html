          <p><strong>History</strong></p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Dancebreak began in Fall 2005, as &quot;Faster
          Polka.&quot;  (We used that name because we thought it
          would force us to come up with a better name.)  In
          those days, each quarter Richard Powers taught
          non-Stanford social dance series courses that were open
          to both students and the outside community on Thursday
          nights, 7-10pm.  In addition, Roble Gym closed at
          10:50pm.  This left the big studio unused for the
          final 50 minutes (since no group wanted the space at
          that late hour for such short a block of time).  When
          we realized that, we asked for (and received)
          permission from Richard to stay after his class and use
          the big studio.  This provided us a nice, if short,
          weekly dance where we decided what music to play and
          dances to dance.  5 weeks into the quarter, Richard's
          courses would conclude, and because no other group was
          already reserving the big studio for Thursday nights,
          we could make our start time earlier, thus enjoying an
          even-longer weekly dance of our own!</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>In Spring 2009, concerned we were giving people the
          wrong impression about our focus (and possibly
          unintentionally intimidating them), we finally renamed
          ourselves &mdash; to &quot;Dancebreak.&quot;</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Richard's non-Stanford classes moved off-campus in
          Winter 2010, and other groups wanted Thursday nights
          too, so we chose to try different nights.  We have
          mostly alternated between Monday and Wednesday nights,
          with Mondays being preferred due to potential conflict
          with other dance events on other weeknights.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>We became an official Voluntary Student Organization
          in Fall 2013, thanks to the efforts of Tatiana
          Kuzovleva (BS 2015), who became our first president.
          Roble Gym was scheduled to be closed for a long-overdue
          renovation starting Summer 2013 (the renovation
          actually began 1 year late).  Although this didn't
          immediately affect us (Dancebreak holds regular
          sessions only during the academic year), it forced us
          to look for alternative space on campus, many of which
          were unavailable except to student groups (or charged
          fees).  That motivated us to become an actual student
          group.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Dancebreak's focus has changed over the years.
          Originally, most attendees were dancers in Richard's
          9pm class, which was usually intermediate-level.  Thus
          we tended to play music for intermediate level dancing
          (such as faster polkas, a particular favorite of the
          early crowd).  After Richard started holding his
          non-Stanford classes off-campus, and especially after
          the early attendees graduated, we shifted our focus to
          being a practica for Richard's Stanford dance classes,
          in order to help and encourage new dancers to discover
          a love and passion for social dancing like the original
          dancers had.</p>
