WARNING:  NEVER EDIT/CHANGE FILES ON THE WEBSERVER!

Updating the Website
--------------------
Here is the procedure (as of November 2019):

1.  SSH onto rice.

        > ssh [your-sunet-id]@rice.stanford.edu

2.  Go to the website directory.

        > cd /afs/ir.stanford.edu/group/dancebreak/WWW

3.  Delete any existing staging directory.  (There shouldn't be
    one if all steps in this document are always followed.)

        > rm -fr staging

4.  Clone the latest version into a new staging directory (you'll
    need your GitLab credentials).

        > git clone https://gitlab.com/stanford-dancebreak/website staging

    NOTE (GitLab credentials):  you only need your GitLab
    username and password here; you will not need any SSH keys.
    In fact, you will be prompted for them -- e.g. you should see

        > git clone https://gitlab.com/stanford-dancebreak/website staging
        Username for 'https://gitlab.com': Tatiana
        Password for 'https://Tatiana@gitlab.com':

    NEVER UPLOAD YOUR SSH KEYS TO rice FOR THIS PURPOSE!

5.  Remove git metadata to prevent leakage of private data, such
    as email addresses of maintainers.  (Although the .htaccess
    file is set up to prevent access via the web, this ensures
    that there is no data to leak.)

        > rm -fr staging/.git*

6.  Check the staging site to make sure everything looks good.

        Browser -> dancebreak.stanford.edu/staging

7.  Move the previous contents out of the main site.  WARNING:
    pay close attention to spaces and punctuation marks in the
    command -- they are all required!

        > mkdir TO_DELETE
        > mv .* * TO_DELETE

   NOTE (warning messages):  you will see warning messages, which
   you can ignore -- e.g. you should see

        > mv .* * TO_DELETE
        mv: cannot move '.' to 'TO_DELETE/.': Device or resource busy
        mv: cannot move '..' to 'TO_DELETE/..': Device or resource busy
        mv: cannot move 'TO_DELETE' to a subdirectory of itself, 'TO_DELETE/TO_DELETE'

8.  Move the new contents into the main site.  WARNING:  pay
    close attention to spaces and punctuation marks in the
    command -- they are all required!

        > mv TO_DELETE/staging/.* TO_DELETE/staging/* .

   NOTE (warning messages):  you will see warning messages, which
   you can ignore -- e.g. you should see

        > mv TO_DELETE/staging/.* TO_DELETE/staging/* .
        mv: cannot move 'TO_DELETE/staging/.' to './.': Device or resource busy
        mv: cannot move 'TO_DELETE/staging/..' to './..': Device or resource busy

9.  Check the main site to make sure everything looks good.

        Browser -> dancebreak.stanford.edu/

10.  Delete the old contents.

        > rm -fr TO_DELETE

11.  Done!
