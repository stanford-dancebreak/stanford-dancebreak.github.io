This How-To documents how to update the website on the Stanford
webserver.

For making changes, see HOW-TO-Setup-Editing.txt for details.

WARNING:  NEVER EDIT/CHANGE FILES ON THE WEBSERVER!

Updating the Website
--------------------
Here is the procedure (as of September 2018):

1.  SSH onto rice.

        > ssh [your-sunet-id]@rice.stanford.edu

2.  Go to the website directory.

        > cd /afs/ir.stanford.edu/group/dancebreak/WWW

3.  Go into the staging directory.

        > cd staging

4.  Pull the changes into the staging site/directory (you'll need
    your GitLab credentials).

        > git pull

    NOTE (GitLab credentials):  you only need your GitLab
    username and password here; you will not need any SSH keys.
    In fact, you will be prompted for them -- e.g. you should see

        > git pull
        Username for 'https://gitlab.com': Bob
        Password for 'https://Bob@gitlab.com':

    NEVER UPLOAD YOUR SSH KEYS TO rice FOR THIS PURPOSE!

5.  Check the staging site to make sure everything looks good.

        Browser -> dancebreak.stanford.edu/staging

6.  Go to the main directory, and pull into the main site:

        > cd ..
        > git pull staging

7.  Check the main site to make sure everything looks good.

        Browser -> dancebreak.stanford.edu/

8.  Done!
