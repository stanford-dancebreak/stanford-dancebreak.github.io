About

This How-To documents how to set up your local computer in order
to make changes to the website repository.

Setup
-----
There's not much to do to setup, but here we go:

1.  Pull the repository to your local machine with

        > git clone git@gitlab.com:stanford-dancebreak/website.git

That's it!  Everything is set up for you to edit the repository
and pages and everything...

Offsite Testing
---------------
In order to view these files in your browser, you must first run
the "OffsiteMake.sh" script:

        > ./OffsiteMake.sh

HTML files will not properly render outside the Stanford
webserver due to the use of Server Side Include (SSI) files.
They look like the following:

        <!--#include virtual="includes/stdhead.ssi"-->

The script will create a copy of the files in your temporary
directory (under "/tmp/dancebreak_website_<username>"), or update
the ones there, with the HTML files modified to render correctly.
You can then view the files with your browser at:

        Browser -> file:///tmp/dancebreak_website_<username>/index.html

REMINDER:  RUN THE SCRIPT BEFORE BROWSING IF YOU'VE PULLED DOWN A
FRESH COPY OR MADE ANY CHANGES!
